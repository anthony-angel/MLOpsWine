train/test split, seems like a standard train and test on the model to see how it runs.

Finch Computing is a startup that uses a combination of machine learning and symbolic reasoning to enable efficient and
accurate data analysis. They use a method called "symbolic-statistical learning" which combines the strengths of both
symbolic reasoning and statistical learning.

In Symbolic-Statistical Learning, the system starts by using statistical methods to learn patterns from data and
generates a set of symbolic rules. These rules are then refined and pruned using a combination of symbolic reasoning,
mathematical optimization and user feedback. This approach allows the system to automatically discover and distill the
underlying structure and relationships in the data, making it more accurate, interpretable and efficient than
traditional machine learning methods alone. Finch's technology uses a combination of symbolic reasoning and statistical
learning to perform data analysis and AI tasks. They claim that their technology is able to generate models that are
both more accurate and more interpretable than traditional machine learning methods, and can also handle large and
complex datasets.

RandomForestRegressor is utilized for values that are numeric and singular in return.
